The only way to prevent that from happening is to set boundaries with him. \r\n\r\nIf he steps on the keyboard, remove him from the desk and place him on the ground. You will need to REPEATEDLY do this EVERY TIME. He will very quickly learn that as soon as he steps on the keyboard, that means he is going to be removed from the desk. \r\n\r\nIt may take him 30 minutes of continually doing this, it may take 2 hours of continually doing this, but as long as you are consistent, he will learn quickly.\r\n\r\nThis method I am providing you is a common way to train both dogs and cats. You need to stay firm with your boundaries and do not alter them.\r\n\r\nFor instance, if one day you feel that him stepping on your keyboard does not bother you, and you do not take action and place him on the ground, you will now need to RETEACH him the whole process and spend another 2 hours doing so.\r\n\r\n\r\nI hope this helps and good luck!"

I enjoy my cat's company while working, so would rather not shut him out.\r\n\r\nSince this is Lifehacks, I figure it's fine to offer an alternative solution:\r\n\r\n## Install a cat typing detector on your computer.\r\n\r\nThis is software that detects when the keyboard is being operated in a non-humanlike manner (presumably, e.g. with clusters of nearby keys being pressed simultaneously), and locks the keyboard when that happens.\r\n\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\r\n[![PawSense screenshot][1]][2]  \r\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\r\n<sup>([Source][3])</sup>\r\n\r\nSome can also be configured to emit a loud noise when they detect a cat on the keyboard, hopefully annoying the cat enough to keep them away even if you're not around to move them off.  Or you can disable that feature and just let your cat lounge on your keyboard as much as she likes, secure in the knowledge that it won't harm your computer (except maybe by getting the fans full of cat hair, but that'll happen anyway).\r\n\r\nThe one I've personally used, and can testify to the effectiveness of, is [PawSense][3], which the screenshot above comes from.  Alas, it's Windows-only, and somewhat pricey too, but my parents own a license and have been quite satisfied with it. [ And it's even won an IgNobel prize!](http://priceonomics.com/the-software-that-detects-when-a-cat-is-messing/) ;-)\r\n\r\nApparently, there's a program called [CatNip](https://people.math.osu.edu/fowler.291/software/cat-nip/) that does the same for OS X.  Alas, I'm not yet aware of equivalent software for Linux.  Apparently, in this particular respect, open source *is* (so far) inferior! ;-)\r\n\r\nPs.

In practice, this simply doesn't happen; you can tell when clothes need washing.\n\nI gave up my own chair about 2 years ago, and can attest that the wash-or-wardrobe method works well in practice.\n\nIn summary, then, I'd say your challenge isn't to find a different resting place for half-worn clothes, but to see the problem differently.

So I spot wash anything with a stain and at this point I can't tell the difference from clean clothes, so I exploit this so the clothes can actually be put back with the clean clothes in the first place.\r\n\r\nWrinkles are a problem, and since an iron is too much work another great life hack is to use a hand-steamer, which is easy to store and operate and works just as well. Again at this point the clothes have reached a state where they able to go into the wardrobe without any confusion or unsightliness.\r\n\r\nI've found this system is a really huge improvement on the state of my room and my wardrobe because it's a backdoor approach to avoiding having another category of storage that I had difficulty getting to really work out right.

If you've been dating seriously for awhile, you'd be surprised how often this type of thing comes up. If neither of them know her ring size, they will likely be more than happy to get in on the intrigue. They can (more easily than you) find out her size under the guise of buying a gift or some other type of conversational pretense like *\"damn, you really need to know such things just in case, y'know?\"* Of course, all oaths of secrecy apply.\n\n### The Solo Scenario\n\nIf you decide to go with this on your own &mdash; when you are buying a ring from a jeweler, you typically buy the ring in their \"standard\" size; I believe it is usually a size 7. Display case rings are typically made a bit larger by design because they want a prospective buyer to be able to see it on their finger; that plus it is typically less destructive to resize the ring smaller than to try and make it bigger later. \n\nAsk the jeweler about the design of the ring and if knowing the ring size is more or less important than sizing it later. If the shank is plain (the part that wraps around the bottom), re-sizing is easy. If it's too big, they simply slice out a small portion at the bottom and join the ends seamlessly. If it's too small, the metal can be heated and stretched, but the thickness of the band will determine how much they can size it before more material has to be added. Adding material can leave a slight line between the old and new metal, so it is better get the bigger ring. \n\nIf the ring shank is more ornamental (encrusted with diamonds or something), the ring size is sometimes best known *before* the ring is even made. That may be a factor in your decision about which ring to purchase. Ask the jeweler.\n"

Then compare that sense impression against your sister, mother, friends, your own fingers (pinky, perhaps?) and those of the ring salesperson.\r\n\r\nErr on the size of being too big.  If she says yes, at least you won't draw blood cramming it onto her finger. Then get it resized as necessary. If all else fails she can wear it on a chain around her neck until it's resized. Maybe you should carry a chain in your pocket when you propose, just in case?\r\n\r\nAs pointed out in one of the comments, completely surprising her with the *whole idea of getting married* (rather than just the circumstances of when you'll ask) is not necessarily as good an idea as our romantic-fiction-driven ideals would lead us to believe.  Make sure you and she are on the same page about marriage, without necessarily making her certain whether/when you will propose. \r\n\r\nAlso, if her parents are at all present/important in her life, make the effort to get their blessing before you propose. Their refusal won't make anything worse than it would end up being anyway, whereas their blessing will make everything *much* happier for all.\r\n\r\nOh and one final note, having read one of the previous answers. If you surprise her a little, and you make it romantic, and you offer to devote the rest of your life to her, and while offering her **a diamond ring** to seal all of this you explain the very reasonable fact that you didn't know her ring size so it might be a little too big---if after all of that she looks at the size and scowls and says \"oh, so you think I'm that fat??\"---then, my friend, this is what you do:  **marry someone else**."

Find a high-resolution photograph of the two of you where both hands are visible and in close proximity (to ensure there is no foreshortening due to perspective effects).\r\n\r\n 2. Crop the photograph to the portion containing your fingers. Enlarge and print onto paper.\r\n\r\n 3. Measure (using a ruler) the **image** diameter of your finger on the photograph (call it a1) and the same measurement of your partner's finger (call it a2). These will depend on how zoomed-in the photograph is.\r\n\r\n 4. Determine the **actual** diameter (d1) of your own finger by discovering your own ring-size and using a conversion table such as [http://www.onlineconversion.com/ring_size.htm][1].\r\n\r\n 5. Calculate the actual diameter d2 of your partner's finger by the formula d2 = a2 * (d1 / a1).\r\n\r\n 6. Convert this into your partner's ring-size by the same conversion table used in step 4.\r\n\r\nThe result should be accurate to within a fraction of a millimetre (so you'll be able to determine exactly which US ring-size is closest to your partner's).\r\n\r\n\r\n**EDIT:** I actually tried this out shortly after posting the answer.

You do not have to listen to what they say, just make sure you are aware of when they finally stop talking. Then, say, you hadn't quite understood, or you had to leave for a moment, or something like that, and ask them to explain again<sup>1</sup>. Repeat until the annoyed cold caller hangs up.\r\n\r\nYes, cold calling people is their job. I want them to work for the money they get, not idle. A job where you can idle much of the time is attractive. A job where you have to work endlessly and get a feeling that your work is in vain is unattractive. An unattractive job has a chance of requiring higher payment at some point, or at least a higher frequency of people quitting. Also, occupying more time of those cold callers sounds good, too. These are probably the only effects on the decision makers that can be achieved directly via the cold call itself.\r\n\r\n<sup>1</sup>: Make sure not to use any words that could be remixed to indicate agreement to buy anything. The details of this are language-specific, but for instance, when asked whether you'd like more information, don't respond \"Yes, I do.\", but rather something like \"Explain, please.\""

I really tried to build a friendship with the guy, and he felt really comfortable telling me all kinds of things. Then he said \"Well, my friend, let me ask you about...\", and I just hung up on him. I wasted lots of his time, the company's money, and I learned something interesting about life outside my bubble. If you got enough people to spend 30 minutes on the phone to not make a sale, you would affect the profits.\r\n\r\nOf course, this doesn't work with robot calls, but then you really should have caller ID by now, and just never answer \"Unknown Caller\" or suspicious numbers anyway.\r\n\r\nEither way... yea, it can waste your time too - if you really had something to do - and there might be better solutions out there, but I figure you're doing two things: you're growing as a person, and being a turd in \"The Man's\" punchbowl.

Possible explanations for placing the filler opposite the driver include emergency fueling while pulled over. This also holds for placing the filler on the left for Japanese cars since Japan drives on the left [1]\r\n\r\n.. then further down\r\n\r\n> <b>Patterns for individual automakers (with a few exceptions, not all listed):</b>\r\n> It would be neat to see an infographic organizing this.\r\n> \r\n> <b>Japanese (90%+ left)</b>: Japanese cars are consistent within their model\r\n> lines and even parent companies.

This realization would have been bad for a mathematician: It means that true cleanliness can only ever be approached, never reached. Alas, I am an engineer, and for me exponential decay is very good news. It means that I can get the amount down a lot with just a little persistence; and where a  mathematician only has an infinite featureless floor, I have djechlin's carpet which will take care of the rounding errors.\r\n\r\nThe underlying observation was that even versus the end of the \"shoveling-into-the-dust-pan-process\", each sweep *does* move a certain fraction of the dust into the dust pan, which is of course the reason for exponential reduction.\r\n\r\nAs an engineer I'm bound to link practice and math. On the practical side, the removed fraction can be increased by:\r\n\r\n - Moving the dust pan an inch or two backward each time to expose any dust that got under the lip before, and to give the dust space to \"jump up\" a bit into the pan;\r\n - tilting the pan forward a little so that the rubber lip is nestled better against the floor, leaving a smaller gap for dust to go into;\r\n - sweeping in a more \"upward\" movement, rolling the hand brush around its handle axis.\r\n\r\nIn this fashion I sweep half a dozen or a dozen times in quick succession, each time moving the pan back a little, each time catching another fraction of the remaining dust. The operation only takes a few seconds and needs maybe one or two feet of space. Because my floor is not featureless I can take advantage of seams and gaps where they are available.\r\n\r\nOn the math side of engineering we can estimate the remaining amount of dust after n sweeps: Even if each sweep only removes 20% of the dust, i.e. 80% of the dust remain, then each three sweeps halve the remaining dust; 12 sweeps reduce it exponentially to 0.8^12 = 0.06, or 6%. That is often good enough to move on to djechlin's strategy ;-)."

Flies have [nearly 360 degree vision](http://animals.pawnation.com/flies-see-out-compound-eye-5361.html), so sneaking won't help.\r\n\r\nFirst, wait for them to land somewhere that you can strike against. Waving them towards an area can help, but isn't fully effective. Once it has landed on an acceptable area, approach the fly slowly, not making any sudden movements. Most of the time the fly will not move unless you get very close. Continue until you're within striking distance.\r\n\r\nOnce you're within striking distance, continue to move your arm that is going to strike the fly closer to the fly until the item you're striking it with is approximately 7-10 inches (18-25 centimeters) away from the fly. Maybe closer if you choose to flick the fly instead. You'll get the feel of it after a few failed attempts where it *flies* away most likely. Then comes the big moment: strike at it as fast as you can. Usually the fly does not have time to react fast enough to escape the blow, especially if the object you're striking with has some width.\r\n\r\nI've killed hundreds of flies this way using my hand, rolled up paper, a shoe, or something similar."

                    "body_markdown":"The reason that flyswatters are more effective than a magazine is because of the holes. Moving a newspaper, magazine or other flat object through the air very quickly actually creates a buffer of air moving in front of the object you're swiping with, which blows the fly out of the way. \r\n\r\nAs well as avoiding the above, a flyswatter's holes enable it to move faster, thus increasing the chance of whacking the fly.\r\n\r\nSo, if you want to improvise a flyswat, I would recommend using any device that has holes in big enough for air to pass through but not big enough for a fly to pass through.\r\n\r\nI would also recommend getting your arm as close as possible (moving slowly) before swatting. This gives the fly less time to react to your movement and decreases the chances of escape.\r\n\r\nFinally, for a less active approach, you can try killing flies without swatting them. A jam jar half-full of sugar water with some holes cut in the lid always worked quite nicely for me, or there are numerous commercial products that attract and trap flies - for example, on sticky paper."

Wait for the fly to land on a flat surface\r\n2. Position your hand 20-100 cm away, along the surface; make sure there is clear space for a swing towards the fly **and beyond**\r\n3. Swing your hand quckly so it passes 1-5 cm above the fly; make sure to make a grabbing motion with your fingers at the right place\r\n\r\nThere is a good chance the fly will feel your approaching hand and decide to fly away; however, it will take off vertically at first, so it will actually fly into your grasp. This method is quick enough so your reaction time is not a factor: you don't have to react to anything. So only your muscles limit your speed, and they seem to accelerate faster than flies can do.\r\n\r\nThe distances I specified vary widely; they depend on the type of the fly, its mood and (maybe most of all) ambient temperature. When it's cold, you might want to make your swing deliberately slow, so the fly has time to try to escape.\r\n\r\n"

[How stuff works](http://home.howstuffworks.com/green-living/homemade-organic-gardening-sprays.htm) recommends 1 to 2 tablespoons liquid soap per quart of water, but I kind of just wing it.\r\nI usually get a trigger-sprayer (like the kind Windex and other cleaners use only I buy them empty), dump some water and soap into it and shoot whatever insect needs taking out.\r\n\r\nThe main drawback is that it's a liquid so you only want to use it where that won't be a problem (also, it will sometimes ground the flies but not immediately kill them so you might need to squish them after the fact with a paper towel or something if you didn't use enough soap).\r\n\r\nAn advantage of the sprayer is you can fiddle with the stream -- use a wider spray to ground the fly without needing to be too accurate then move to a narrower stream once it's stuck on the floor to increase the amount of soap you're sending to it. Additionally, you are spraying soap so you can clean and kill at the same time.\r\n\r\nI have found that this approach (soap sprays) works on just about any insect - flies, cockroaches, centipedes, cabbage worms, etc. so it is a good tool to have in your arsenal in general."

You cock it and when you pull the trigger it blasts a small amount of salt at the fly.  However, if you don't have a fly swatter you might not have a fly gun either.\r\n\r\nRegardless of how you kill the fly, one thing that may help is to immediately close the door of whatever room you are in. Cutting down on where the fly can go will allow you to kill is more easily.  It is also helpful, if you can shoo in into another room, to pick a room that contains lighter colors.  It is very difficult to see a fly against a dark background.  With the door(s) closed and a clear view of the fly you may then be able to search around for something to hit it with, whether it is a shoe, a rolled up newspaper, or whatever.  If you are feeling adventurous, try killing it with your hands, either by clapping your hands as it flies between them, or batting it out of the air to stun it, and then finish it off before it recovers.\r\n\r\nIf the fly is on something you don't want to damage (for instance, as vase or trinket), try picking up the object from behind and then moving it towards your hand.  I actually killed a fly like this recently.  The fly won't sense the movement of your hand as easily as your hand is not moving."

Only your hands.\r\n\r\nBut to understand why that technique works we need to know something about flies. As mentioned by others before, flies have almost 360 degree vision, so they will see you coming. but they have one big handicap: They can **only concentrate on two things**.\r\n\r\nKnowing this, you can slowly approach the fly from behind with your preferred hand and index- and ring-finger spread apart. With any finger of your other hand you pull back your middle finger. It should look something like this:\r\n\r\n[![turn your hand into a fly-killing-machine][1]][2]\r\n\r\nYour index- and ring-finger touching the surface, you move towards the fly. It will concentrate on those two fingers and won't notice your middle finger. Move your hand really slowly, so you don't scare the fly. When the fly is right below your middle finger it's time for the kill. Just pull away the finger pulling back your middle finger - it will snap down and squash the fly.\r\n\r\nYou **will get a dirty finger**, though. But when approaching slowly enough this technique **works every time**.\r\n\r\nThis approach however has one downside. It **only works** good **on flat surfaces** big enough to fit your fingers next to the fly.\r\n\r\nI use this every time a fly lands right on my desk or somewhere near me. I actually prefer using my hands rather than striking with a magazine, since the shockwave of the moving magazine can simply blow away the fly.\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/rLkP1m.jpg\r\n  [2]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/rLkP1.jpg"

A chemical called [Adenosine triphosphate (ATP)][1] is required for muscle contraction. When a muscle fiber contracts, it consumes a tiny amount of ATP from its reservoir. It takes a bit of time to refill the reservoir, so a lot of continuous muscle activity will deplete the reservoir and make muscle contraction quite difficult.  This occurs in your own muscles and, more importantly, in a fly's wing muscles.\r\n\r\nThe idea then is to simply keep the fly flying until such time as it has used up so much ATP that it simply cannot react to even the slowest attempt to swat it.\r\n\r\nWhat I try to do is corral the fly into a small room in the house (bathrooms work best), often using the \"single light on\" trick mentioned in [@Mooseman's answer][2].  Then, whenever the fly lands, I wave my rolled up newspaper (or whatever) at it in order to alarm it and keep it flying.  Over time, the fly reacts more and more slowly to this harassment.  After a few minutes I can just tap the fly with my weapon of choice with no trouble whatsoever.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine_triphosphate\r\n  [2]: https://lifehacks.stackexchange.com/a/1802/10021"

Since then, I have used these two tools.  Each of them is far more effective than a swatter, even more effective than the salt gun.  \r\n\r\nWith the torch, I give a quick press of the electric ignition to let out a quick burst of flame.  You want to aim for just beyond the visible flame, and you will do fine.  Depending on your aim, you will vaporize their wings, and perhaps even their appendages, and they will drop to the ground.  Most of the time, I find tha they are instantly killed. You do need to be careful of your backstop or what ever the fly is perched on. You won't want to hit them if they are sitting on something fragile or flammable, but ceilings, walls, tables, counters, etc are all fine, as long as you are careful about the intensity and duration of the flame. Just give the button a quick flick, nothing more.  I prefer this solution to the salt gun, and have scored may double and even quite a few triple kills with this, as you can angle the flame to wash over one or more flies if they are close enough.  It also is possible to take them down on the wing, just be careful of where you aim it. It also does not disturb the nearby flies, so you can just move about a room taking them all down with a quick depression of a button.\r\n\r\nThe glass cleaner is useful for cases where the backstop would make the torch unsuitable, such as flies landing on a TV or monitor.  Just give them a spritz, and they will be unable to fly and fall to the ground.  While they may not be killed by this [technique][4], I don't think that is necessary, as I police the body with the same paper towel that I use to wipe the cleaner off of the screen.  If you need to have a lethal spray solution, and you want to leave dead flies laying around your house, you can pour some  [alcohol in a spray bottle][5].  The spray bottle is also a tool that will allow you to reliably take down flies in the air.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/zw0tu.jpg\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/R5QFw.jpg\r\n  [3]: https://www.bugasalt.com/?gclid=CjwKCAjwzvX7BRAeEiwAsXExo2sY5sfqAQCkEYy-eAX8hwgS2KYkVf_kcoIkP0EUQALZKMMgiMcwdhoC_agQAvD_BwE\r\n  [4]: https://www.apartmenttherapy.com/can-windex-kill-bugs-like-ants-36643441\r\n  [5]: http://thecharmedkitchen.com/2013/10/05/house-fly-control/"

I've used it more on large trucks than cars.\r\n\r\n**Why do it:** \r\n\r\nIf it makes good sense to let the tailgater go I would generally do so.   \r\nThis may not be the case in some traffic situations where the tailgater is dangerously close if a stop is required and allowing overtaking is not a good immediate option. Reasons for this can arise for a range of reasosns but two typical situations are if allowing overtaking may \r\n\r\n - increase the danger as they overtake (some mix of: tight winding road, low visibility, wet, no overtaking lines, ...) \r\n\r\n - create a situation where my overall 'quality of travel' would be severely degraded with no or vastly less gain (eg stock transporter streaming effluent in a high traffic country road situation - if he overtakes me he is then trapped in front of me and I get splattered with cattle excrement for many miles - dangerous as well as unpleasant.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Warning:** Bear in mind in the following situations that a large laden truck may weigh 40 tons and probably mote than 20, and has a stopping distance better than ocean liners and freight trains but much much much worse than for cars. The action should be taken to try to reduce the chance of deathy not to increase it.\r\n\r\n**Method:** \r\n\r\nEase **very gently** back on throttle to close gap between you and tailgater and, \"until you are **certain** that you have their attention\". ie there WILL come a point where they must be aware that the gap is closing towards zero. You are hardly if at all in any more danger at this point as an accident was almost certain in the prior case in the event of a sudden stop.\r\n\r\nThen **continue** to slowly lower your roadspeed and open the gap between you and the vehicle **ahead** of you. The vehicle behind you has no realistic option but to maintain minimum gp and lower speed. An utter idiot / drunk / man on a mission may make vehicle to vehicle contact, but this is extremely unlikely, and you might as well find out about him now with some degree of control, than later by mistake.  \r\n\r\nWhen an \"adequate\" gap has opened up in front of you accelerate \"very crisply\" and then brake very visibly (good long burst of brakelights) to arrive at and maintain a safe following distance behind the car in front of you.\r\n\r\nThe tailgater is now well clear of you, you are at safe speed and distance from the car in front and the tail gater is travelling below queue speed. They can choose to adapt, to now maintain a safe distance, or may \"as sometimes happens\" accelerate aggressively and get back 'on your tail'. You can repeat the procedure above multiple times and they cannot prevent you doing so BUT odds are that 2 or 3 times max is the most that is useful. It it has not worked after a few applications a modified version will work, one way or another.\r\n\r\n**Plan B**\r\n\r\nDrop back as before and stay back. If possible and useful make it possible for them to overtake safely. If they do not overtake and do not increase the following gap you can maintain a following distance that is enough for both of you in an emergency.\r\n\r\nOccasions where I would try not to allow them to overtake might be the \"stock truck\" situation where they cannot go anywhere once they have passed and will then be splattering excrement all over your car indefinitely. In such cases you can generally control the speed and location of the following vehicle. If they are so aggressive as to continue to threaten your life repeatedly then a record of their number plate and a subsequent telephone call may help prevent others being similarly threatened.  Large heavily laden trucks generally cannot realistically overtake in such situations if not 'allowed to'.\r\n\r\nAgain - the aim is to improve safety and reduce risk overall. If you can realistically let them go then doing so will often be the best choice.\r\n\r\n"

Food with mucokinetics, or mucous-thinning activity, include chilli peppers, garlic, black pepper and curry spices. Capsaicin found in pepper makes your nose run helping you clear your nasal passage. \r\n\r\n - **Vicks Vapor rub**: Apply it on your nose just before you sleep and cover you face with blanket, leave a very small space for breathing.

Just means boiling a kettle of water, pouring some into a bowl, adding whatever you've got handy (**Vick, Olbas Oil, Karvol**, or the cheapest, a teaspoon of **menthol** and **eucalyptus** in a brown bottle from the pharmacy), throwing a towel or something large over your head and the bowl to make a tent, leaning forward over the bowl and inhaling the vapours as deeply as possible for a few minutes. You usually find you have to emerge after a minute or two to blow your nose, but then continue the procedure. Tedious - but it does work. Best done within a couple of hours of going to bed, although repeated treatments during the day do no harm.

                    "body_markdown":"Your sinuses are suffering from vasodilatation or nasal congestion.  There's nothing to blow out that will unblock them because the passages themselves are shrinking due to the blood vessels increasing in size, and the nasal passages shrinking as a result.\r\n\r\nNormally your sinuses do this throughout the day following a [nasal cycle][1] that allows one side to rest and remoisten while the other side handles the majority of the airflow. The frequency of this cycle depends on the environmental factors.\r\n\r\nBut now your body is fighting an infection and it's decided to play Madagascar and shut down everything.  Both nostrils are not only congested, but severely so, to the point where you can't use them.\r\n\r\nSome of the treatments suggested do provide some relief.  **Sitting up decreases blood pressure in the head**, decreasing vasodilation. **Hot steam** provides very temporary relief. A nasal strip can pull the nasal passages open a little more widely.  If your congestion isn't severe, or if you fall asleep quickly, then these might be sufficient.\r\n\r\nIt sounds like your congestion is bad enough, though, that you should look at **[vasoconstricting][2] medications**, otherwise known as decongestants. I recognize you've tried some decongestants, but there're two things you need to understand - first, one very common, over the counter decongestant in the US may not be effective, and second, a nasal spray decongestant should be tried if you've only taken oral decongestants so far.\r\n\r\nTypically **[nasal decongestants][3]** will work in most cases. **[Pseudoephedrine][4]** is the most common over the counter oral decongestant that people indicate works, though in the US it is controlled so you'll have to ask your pharmacist for it (no prescription required). Note that if you're buying an over-the-counter decongestant in the US that doesn't require you to visit the pharmacist, it's probably [Phenylephrine][5], and *\"[clinical studies][6] suggest that phenylephrine is ... not more effective than placebo\"*.  Make sure you try Pseudoephedrine before you give up on oral decongestants. Check your medicine ingredients, and talk to your pharmacist if you have any questions.\r\n\r\nWhen that doesn't work, however, I've found that **a direct decongestant spray**, **[oxymetazoline][7]**, works very quickly and effectively.  This is common enough that you can find it in many brand names and generics, such as Afrin.  There are a number of nasal sprays that claim decongesting effects, but some are simply saline spray.  Make sure you try one with oxymetazoline.\r\n\r\nThey all work the same way but use different routes to the affected area. Direct nasal spray application works very quickly, but can't be timed release, so may need to be used more frequently than an oral decongestant.  Further, they are different drugs, so if one doesn't work, it's worth trying another to see how your body reacts. For me, oxymetazoline beats Pseudoephedrine which beats phenylephrine.\r\n\r\nThere is an issue where if you consistently use them your body starts to work harder to close your nasal passages, which means that once you stop you become congested even if you would normally not be congested at that point.  As such, I've limited my use to only when I need to get to sleep, and usually only one spray (1/2 to 1/3 the recommended dose) in one nostril (I don't need both open to sleep), and alternate nostrils each night. Usually, I've only needed it for a day or two.  If it appears you need it for more than a few days in a row, you should probably consult your doctor or GP to check for bacterial infection or other causes, or a plan to wean you from the medication once the cause is resolved.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_cycle\r\n  [2]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction\r\n  [3]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decongestant\r\n  [4]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoephedrine\r\n  [5]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenylephrine\r\n  [6]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenylephrine#cite_note-danzig09-1\r\n  [7]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxymetazoline"
